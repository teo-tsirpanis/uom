It is well known that the climate is affected by human activities. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, the effects of climate change have been more apparent than ever. Despite the widespread acceptance, there are many people who either deny or downplay the human involvement in the above facts and ignore the overwhelming data that prove the opposite. Scientific research is demonstrating that the average global temperature is rising at increasing rates. The rising temperatures, the ozone hole and extreme weather phenomenae are getting more and more alarming. The causes leading to climate change are many and dangerous.

First of all, one of the primary causes of climate change is air pollution. The infamous carbon dioxide (also known as CO2), a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels is the main culprit of the greenhouse effect. This effect traps the solar rays inside the atmosphere, increasing the global temperature and causing disruption to the natural habitats. CO2 is also emitted by livestock used for food. Petrol and its derivatives are widely used in the energy production industry, yielding 36 billion tons of CO2 last year. These fuels are also used for the transportation of people and goods and are vital for our civilization.

Another crucial factor is deforestation, or in other words, the shrinking of the forest surfaces. When trees are photosynthesing they absorb CO2, which is released when the plant is decomposed or burnt. The summer of 2019 an amazon wildfire destroyed 700.200 square miles of forest area in Brazil through July. This misfortune had a great impact on the volume of greenhouse gases emitted in the atmosphere. 

Moreover, climate change is also contributed by the depletion of the atmosphere's ozone layer. Ozone, while being toxic to humans, is abundant on higher levels of the atmosphere, blocks ultraviolet radiation which is dangerous, as it causes abnormalities on living organisms. Chlorofluorocarbons - also known as CFCs - chemicals useful for refrigerators and sprays were widely used until the adverse effects on the ozone layer were discovered that led to the gas' prohibition. This is some good news, especially since the ozone layer has started to recover in recent years.

To sum up, climate change is a phenomenon that should worry all of us because it can affect the quality of our lives. It is clear that when humankind and our planet are in great danger, we should all act towards that great and crucial goal, being their protection and preservation for the future generation.
