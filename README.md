# University of Macedonia

This repository contains the coding exercises I write for the purpose of my University of Macedonia Applied Informatics undergraduate degree.

They were originally stored in a private GitLab repository, which was synchronized with this public GitHub one, at the end of each semester.

## Support status

While this repository is not under active development, it also is not frozen in time; the latest commit does not represent the assignments as I had submitted them. Code might receive small updates to keep up with the latest frameworks and coding practices.

## A note about plagiarism

This repository is updated after the exercises' deadlines have lapsed. However, it is likely for professors to give the same exercises again either verbatim, or with small modifications.

It might be tempting for a student of the future to copy them, but they have to remember that this is not the purpose of this repository. Think of it like the answers section of textbooks. And I'm pretty sure that exercises are checked for plagiarism by programs.

And wouldn't it be a shame if your assignment was searchable by Google?
