# University of Macedonia

This repository contains the coding exercises I write for the purpose of my University of Macedonia Applied Informatics undergraduate degree.

They are originally stored in a private GitLab repository, which is synchronized with the public GitHub one, at the end of each semester.

## A note about plagiarism

This repository is updated after the exercises' deadlines have lapsed. However, it is likely for professors to give the same exercises again either verbatim, or with small modifications.

It might be tempting for a student of the future to copy them, but he has to remember that this is not the purpose of this repository. Like the answers section of textbooks. And I'm pretty sure that exercises are checked for plagiarism by programs.

And wouldn't it be a shame if your assignment was searchable by Google?
