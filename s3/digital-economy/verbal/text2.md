Over the last decade, it has been noted that more and more news services prefer alternative solutions to reach their audience, like websites or even other platforms like Facebook or YouTube. The reasoning behind the transition of these news services into a more online model is that the younger audiences are skewed towards being informed mostly by social media. Especially, here in Greece over 60% of teenagers between the ages of 18 and 24 prefer Facebook as their main news source ignoring the traditional offline sources like the television, the radio or the newspapers. _So it is clear that the new generation, in conjunction with the evolution of technology, has brought many changes in the way of informing._

First of all, it is known that the young reader do not seek the news anymore but they expect the news to come to them. Having so many options and ways to absorb information is really convenient and undemanding. So the news providers must implement solutions to this problem like abusing keywords and other features of the search engines. Moreover, sending newsletters is an effective way of reaching young readers, although collecting those emails is not an easy task.

In addition to that, after the news services have reached their younger audience, they have to constantly keep their attention. This is harder to achieve nowadays, considering that their competitors, other companies or the platforms themselves are working towards the same goal. This way the news services might have to use unfair mean like catchy titles that don’t represent the article or even fake news in order to acquire the audience’s valuable attention and gain an advantage against the competitors keeping them in an intense race of quantity over quality.

Last but not least, news services had to find new solutions to their problems due to the fact that the younger audience consume news differently nowadays. When a serious or interesting event happens, most of the teenagers tend to increase the usage of social media in order to be kept informed. As a result, the news services have to constantly provide fast updates on the events not just by text but with use of other media like visual formats or audio podcasts which are consider as the dominant way of capturing attention.

To sum up, the younger generation made the news services change the way they provide news and supplant the traditional news sources. Although, social media and the Internet in general is the dominant way of getting informed nowadays the evolution of technology can bring more and faster changes. We can expect that these changes will force the news services to find new ways of reaching younger demographics.
